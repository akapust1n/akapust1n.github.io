Hello, this is the final GSOC blog.

Over the past three months, I've been working on a telemetry project for the graphic editor Krita.
I achieved almost all the goals. A working prototype was created, you can help in its testing by downloading a test version of the Krita with telemetry support.  [link](https://krita.org/en/item/google-summer-of-code-help-alexey-kapustin-by-testing-his-work/)

Not everything works perfectly, but I think that I will be able to fix everything to the release. It is planned to include telemetry in the release of Krita 4.0
It was interesting to work on this project, I learned a lot of new things, talked to new people, wrote a lot of code :)
